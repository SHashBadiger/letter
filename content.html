  <h1>¬°¬°happy anniversary <span style="color: #ec0005;">babygirl</span>!!</h1>
  <p>To call you the love of my life would not be doing justice to the way I feel about you. It is honestly bizarre to think about how I met the girl of my dreams when I was THIRTEEN and to be able to call you mine? Honestly, who is lucky enough to be able to say those words? Building our relationship for the last half decade has been my greatest achievement in the past 19 years we‚Äôve graced this earth.</p>
<p>I do not mean to take away from today but my goal in our hopefully long long relationship is to make sure that our 5 anniversary is only the beginning of our life together. A short preface in our book because you are the only future I am certain of and I know we have so much more coming our way. You are my constant lara. My calm in chaos, my center of gravity, you are my everything. Even when life gets heavy and times get tough, you are not someone I run from to find space-you are the warm fireplace I run to on a freezing night. You are the warmth I did not know I needed till I met you. To love you is so effortless- it feels like breathing. Just constant, consistent and so so natural.</p>
<p>I am so grateful that you had the courage to ask me out 5 years ago. I will forever be grateful to you for that. You are one of the most courageous people I have ever met in my life even though you can not sit through a Harry Potter movie without grabbing my arm or have designated letterboxed opening time. But seriously, jokes aside, the guts you have to do what you need to is so admirable. I genuinely do look up to you for that. You NEVER let the situation define you, if you really want it you just go for it and that takes real courage. The only reason I have been able to be true to myself and to you is because I have learnt it from you. You never take bullshit from people, you do not let other people define you, you stay genuine. I am so grateful that I have you and that we are building a relationship that is not holding us back but rather propelling us forward. It's like using one another's momentum to help lurch the other one forward. A true dynamic duo.</p>
<p>The other day, I got to thinking about all the things I tend to reminisce on- my travels, my childhood, spending time with the guys, blah blah blah you get it. The point is, I noticed that I do not reminisce about us.  I realised that I do not reminisce about us because to reminisce implies that it's in the past, the best part is over. With you lara, it's been a continuous stream of well ‚Äúthe best part‚Äù. The honeymoon phase never faded, we‚Äôre still living it except for us, it's not a phase anymore, it is our reality. Five years later, I feel just as strongly about you as I did on day one. You keep me on my toes (in every way possible if you know what I mean ;)), I never grow weary of you, it‚Äôs as if we are one.</p>
<p>I love you Lara, I have since that day 5 years ago.  I love you so much and I can't wait to find out what we have coming our way in the future.You are my best friend, partner, wifey, lover-<br>
<u><b>you are THE one</b></u>.</p>

<p>Forever yours,<br>
<span style="color: #B22222;">Pookie</span> <span style="color: 	#CC5500;">wookie</span> <span style="color: #DAA520;">princess</span> <span style="color: #228B22;">angel</span> <span style="color: #4682B4;">fairy</span> <span style="color: #483D8B;">unicorn</span> <span style="color: #BA55D3;">sprinkles</span> </p><br>

   <p><b>Ps:</b> I apologise for keeping this short and sweet but I don't want to be repeating myself a lot for your birthday letter either so think of this as pt1.<br>

   <b>Pss:</b> Your ass is still out of this world. That has not changed. <b>#phenomenalbootayproblemsStillValidüçë</b>
